      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi. I'm a 20-something University of Illinois alum who now wants to learn web development to bring those skills to my family business.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from west central Illinois, a small town called Cuba with a population of 1,300.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my freetime I enjoy being outdoors, working on my farm, and reading.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Business owner</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Farmington, a small town in west central Illinois near where I grew up.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As mentioned, I am looking forward to bringing the skills I learn to my family's business. Part of what we do is webdevelopment in the ag sector, but had to put that on hold with layoffs due to Covid. I'm looking forward to offering this service to our customers again. </p>
